# obsoletion

This repository's issue tracker is used to file requests for the TAG to consider a specification to be obsoleted, recinded, or restored per the W3C Process: [ยง6.9 Obsoleting or Rescinding a W3C Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#rec-rescind).

These requests should only be filed with the TAG when the working group that created the specification in question is no longer active.
